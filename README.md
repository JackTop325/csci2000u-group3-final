###**Introduction**
This paper will go over the fuel consumption statistics of newly-released vehicles available for sale in Canada from 1995 to 2014.

The data being analyzed was published by Natural Resources Canada, and contains data that includes but is not limited to the vehicle model, class, consumption, and emissions. By working with this data, it is possible to determine which vehicles are the most-efficient in terms of fuel consumption, and use this to improve performance going forward.
